A function is a piece of prewritten code that performs an operation. 
Python has numerous built-in functions that perform various operations. 
Perhaps the most fundamental built-in function is the print function, which displays output on the screen. 
Here is an example of a statement that executes the print function:
```
print('Hello World')
```
In interactive world if you type this statement and press ```enter``` key, the message ```Hello World``` is Displayed.
Heres the Example: vvv
```
>>> print('Hello World')
Hello World
```
When Programmers excute a function, they say that they are "calling the function".
When you call the ```print```. Followed by a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you type an ARGUMENT, 
which is data that you want displayed on the screen. 
In the previous example, the argument is ``` 'Hello World' ```. Notice the quote marks are not displayed when the statement ecxecutes. 
The Quote marks simply specify the beginning and the end of the text that you wish to display
Suppose your instructor tells you to write a program that displays your name and address on the computer screen. The Example (shown below) shows an example of such a program, with the output that it will prodice when it runs.
vvv
(output.py)
```
print('Andy Alonso')
print('123 Your moms house place')
print('Miami, FL 22269')
```
PROGRAM OUTPUT:
```
Andy Alonso
123 Your moms house place
Miami, FL 22269
```
