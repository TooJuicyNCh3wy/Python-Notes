Programmers commonly have to write code that performs the same task over and over. For example, suppose you have been asked to write a program that calculates a 10 percent sales commission for several salespeople. Although it would not be a good design, one approach would be to write the code to calculate one salespersonâ€™s commission, and then repeat that code for each salesperson. For example, look at the following:
```
# Get a salesperson's sales and commission rate.
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))

# Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate

# Display the commission.
print(f'The commission is ${commission:,.2f}')

# Get another salesperson's sales and commission rate.
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))

# Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate

# Display the commission.
print(f'The commission is ${commission:,.2f}')

# Get another salesperson's sales and commission rate.
sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))

# Calculate the commission.
commission = sales * comm_rate

# Display the commission.
print(f'The commission is ${commission:,.2f}')
```
```
And This Code goes on and on...
```
As you can see, this code is one long sequence structure containing a lot of duplicated code. There are several disadvantages to this approach, including the following:

  - The duplicated code makes the program large.
  - Writing a long sequence of statements can be time consuming.
  - If part of the duplicated code has to be corrected or changed, then the correction or change has to be done many times.

Instead of writing the same sequence of statements over and over, a better way to repeatedly perform an operation is to write the code for the operation once, then place that code in a structure that makes the computer repeat it as many times as necessary. This can be done with a repetition structure, which is more commonly known as a loop.

Condition-Controlled and Count-Controlled Loops
==============================================

A condition-controlled loop uses a true/false condition to control the number of times that it repeats. A count-controlled loop repeats a specific number of times. In Python you can use the while statement and the for statement to write these types of loop. In this chapter we will demonstrate both.
