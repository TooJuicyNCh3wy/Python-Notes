A running total is a sum of numbers that accumulates with each iteration of a loop. The variable used to keep the running total is called an accumulator. Many programming tasks require you to calculate the total of a series of numbers. For example, suppose you are writing a program that calculates a businessâ€™s total sales for a week. The program would read the sales for each day as input and calculate the total of those numbers. Programs that calculate the total of a series of numbers typically use two elements: A loop that reads each number in the series. A variable that accumulates the total of the numbers as they are read. The variable that is used to accumulate the total of the numbers is called an accumulator. It is often said that the loop keeps a running total because it accumulates the total as it reads each number in the series
