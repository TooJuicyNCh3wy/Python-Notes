Comments are notes of explanation that document lines or sections of a program. 

Comments are part of the program, but the Python interpreter ignores them. They are intended for people who may be reading the source code.

Comments are short notes placed in different parts of a program, explaining how those parts of the program work. Although comments are a critical part of a program, they are ignored by the Python interpreter.

Comments are intended for any person reading a programâ€™s code, not the computer. 

In Python, you begin a comment with the # character. When the Python interpreter sees a # character, it ignores everything from that character to the end of the line. For example, as shown below
```
# This program displays a person's
# Name and Address
print("Andy Alonso")
print("123 Your moms House Place")
print("Miami, FL 22269")
```
Programmers commonly write end-line comments in their code. An end-line comment is a comment that appears at the end of a line of code. It usually explains the statement that appears in that line.
```
print("Andy Alonso")                    # Disaplys the name
print("123 Your moms House Place")      # Displays the address
print("Miami, FL 22269")                # Displays the city, State, and ZIP
```
As a beginning programmer, you might be resistant to the idea of liberally writing comments in your programs. After all, it can seem more productive to write code that actually does something! It is crucial that you take the extra time to write comments, however. They will almost certainly save you and others time in the future when you have to modify or debug the program. Large and complex programs can be almost impossible to read and understand if they are not properly commented.
