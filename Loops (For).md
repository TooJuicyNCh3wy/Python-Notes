For loops in Python are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). The basic syntax is:
```
for element in sequence:
    # block of code to be executed for each element in the sequence
```
Example:
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```
The loop above prints the name of each fruit in the fruits list.

For loops can also iterate over ranges, strings, and even dictionaries. Here are a few more examples:
```
# Iterating over a range of numbers
for i in range(1, 4):  # Will iterate from 1 to 3
    print(i)

# Iterating over a string
for char in "Hello":
    print(char)
```
