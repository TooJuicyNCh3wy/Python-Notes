How to Create a Variable in Python
Variables in Python are like labels that you attach to values. They allow you to store and manipulate data in your programs. Creating a variable in Python is straightforward; you just assign a value to a name without needing to declare its type explicitly.

```
my_number = 10
my_name = "Faizan"
```

In this example, ```my_number```is a variable that holds the value 10, and ```my_name``` is another variable that holds the value "Faizan". Python understands the type of variable based on the value assigned to it.

Variables can also store different types of data. You can also change the value of a variable after it's been created.
```
# Changing the value
my_number = 10
my_number = 20
print(my_number)  # Output: 20

# Using the variable in operations
my_number = my_number + 5
print(my_number)  # Output: 25
```
